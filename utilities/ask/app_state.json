Do not remove or alter comments, docstrings, or formatting in the original source files.\n3. Only add or adapt the specific function or section explicitly assigned. Never modify unrelated code.\n4. Always preserve previous code and show it fully before modifying.\n5. Every change must be incremental, auditable, and reversible.\n6. Keep debug output visible at every stage.\n7. If you lose context, ask for confirmation before acting.\n8. Do not invent new functions unrelated to the current flow.\n9. Always use clear comments in English to document each adjustment.\n10. Maintain consistency in file names, functions, and variables.\n11. Each response must include the full updated source code, not just fragments.\n12. Always show the filename and full absolute path before presenting any code.\n13. Do not provide snippets, summaries, or partial explanations \u2014 only complete code listings with context.\n14. If modifications are requested, reprint the entire file with changes applied, never partial diffs.\n15. If a rule conflicts, prioritize showing complete source code with filename and path.\n16. Warn explicitly if any requested change could cause loss of existing functionality.\n17. If a file is too large to fit in a single response, deliver the entire file in sequential parts, clearly labeled (e.g., \"Part 1 of N\"), until the full source code has been shown. Never omit or skip sections.\n18. Never attempt to optimize or refactor existing code unless explicitly instructed. Focus only on the assigned addition/adaptation.\n\n",
