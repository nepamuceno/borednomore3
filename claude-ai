Task 1: in borednomore3.py

Modify 1: In borednomore3.py or borednomore3 (binary): like to add a new argument to load a config named borednomore.conf, in this
file is containing all de arguments default values including the string for the borednomore3-gui binary
When borednomore3.py is launched, the borednomore3.py reads the filename assigned by the argument if exist.
If does not exist search for borednomore3.conf file and loads those values from the borednomore3.conf file
after that overwrite those values with the arguments values if are available, if any argument or conf variable
is missing, default to the borednomore3.py or binary borednomore3 default values inside the program for safety.

Modify 2: Add another argument that when exist this flag is true, default is False when not especified, this
flag is gone control the way transitions are served, call this flag KEEP_IMAGE

Task 2: in borednomore3_gui (binary version)

Problem 1: Still trying to run the .py version insted of the compiled version when
the binary file borednomore3-gui is called.

Task 3:
In borednomore3_gui (binary version)

Modify 1, add all arguments from default values to be able to be modify via <program> [args]
and add a new one to load the borednomore3.conf file, the handle of the arguments will be
the same way as borednomore3 is doing it, explain When borednomore3_gui.py or binary borednomore3_gui
is executed, the program reads the filename assigned by the argument if exist.
If does not exist search for borednomore3.conf file and loads those values from the borednomore3.conf file
after that overwrite those values with the arguments values if are available, if any argument or conf variable
is missing, default to the borednomore3.py or binary borednomore3 default values inside the program for safety.

Modify 2: Rebuild the borednomore3_gui.py to load the final values into the gui, including a space to
define the configuration file (borednomore3.conf or the one input into the argument that defines
the .conf file path/file, make it browsable so user can choose from and add a checkbox for the new
KEEP_IMAGE flag.

Modify 3: When the service is started, the program will look for the string that define
the borednomore3 (.py or binary version) and execute that program, i like to see
the way that program was called [program] [arguments] in the console log screen.
Problem 1: Still trying to run the .py version insted of the compiled version when
the binary file borednomore3-gui is called.

Console Log: This is the console log screen output,
and there is no \n separating the log lines, here is output of the console
log screen:

Task 3: in borednomore3_transitions.py

Problem 1: Some Transition do the same as other transitions, i like to modify them
as the very first transition be a just go from imageA to ImageB, then when KEEP_IMAGE is True de IMAGEA stays 
in the desktop when transition is executing and ImageB overwrites ImageA into overwrites the whole desktop, when
is false the ImageA moves togather with ImageB to the left, right, up, down, etc

Problem 2: Fix Duplicate translations, i like 2: right-left, left-right, down-up, up-down, fade-in, fade-ot, zoom-in, 
zoom-out, focus-in, focus out, add more as need itm do not be shine to just 40 transition make 100 or more but make
it like if for example: left-upper-corner to right-bottom-corner make sure you have the reversed version too: 
right-bottom-corner to left-upper-corner, etc, in other words, make on transition and add the reversed version.

Net i will provide the 3 files for modification: borednomore3_transitions.py borednomore3.py borednomore3_gui.py
