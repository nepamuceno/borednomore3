.SH DESCRIPTION
.B borednomore3-downloader
is a powerful utility designed to fetch high-quality wallpapers from multiple online sources. It features a smart sequential numbering system that prevents filename collisions and utilizes SHA256 hashing to ensure no duplicate images are saved, even when sourced from different websites.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d, \-\-directory " path"
Directory where wallpapers will be saved. The script automatically scans this directory to determine the next sequential number. Default: \fB.\fR (current directory).

The search term used to find relevant images across all sources. Use quotes for multi-word queries. Default: \fB"dark wallpaper"\fR.

Total number of wallpapers to attempt to download. Default: \fB10\fR.
