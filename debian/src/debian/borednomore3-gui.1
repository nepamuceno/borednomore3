.TH BOREDNOMORE3-GUI 1 "January 2026" "3.1.5" "BoredNoMore3 Manual"
.SH NAME
borednomore3-gui \- Advanced Mission Control for the BoredNoMore3 Wallpaper Engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B borednomore3-gui
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B borednomore3-gui
is a high-performance graphical interface built with \fICustomTkinter\fR. It acts as a wrapper for the \fBborednomore3\fR backend, allowing real-time monitoring of the wallpaper engine, transition selection, and engine parameter tuning through a "Mission Control" style dashboard.

The GUI utilizes a dedicated threading model to ensure the interface remains responsive even while the heavy image-processing transition matrix is active.
.SH SIDEBAR CONTROLS
The sidebar provides the primary engine configuration:
.TP
.B System Ready / Uptime
Displays the current engine status and a live clock showing how long the engine has been active.
.TP
.B Interval (Sec)
Numerical input to set the delay between wallpaper changes.
.TP
.B Animation Density
Controls the number of frames used during transitions (Higher = smoother but more CPU intensive).
.TP
.B Transition Speed
Adjusts the floating-point delay between frames. Recommended range: 0.0001 to 0.01.
.TP
.B Randomize Sequence
Toggle switch to choose between sequential or shuffled wallpaper transitions.
.TP
.B Initialize / Stop Engine
Primary triggers to spawn or terminate the background engine thread.
.SH TRANSITION MATRIX
The central panel features a grid of 40 checkboxes. Each corresponds to a specific OpenCV-powered transition effect (e.g., crossfade, slide, pixelate).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSelect All\fR: Mass-enables all available transitions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBClear\fR: Disables all transitions (at least one must be selected for the engine to start).
.SH ENGINE CONSOLE
A read-only, green-text terminal at the bottom of the window.
.TP
.B Output
Displays real-time logging from the core engine, including file paths of loaded images and transition metadata.
.TP
.B Export Log
Saves the current console buffer to \fIengine_log.txt\fR in the current working directory.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I borednomore3.py
The required backend logic file containing the \fBBoredNoMore3\fR class.
.TP
.I borednomore3_transitions.py
Metadata file containing the names and IDs of the transition effects.
